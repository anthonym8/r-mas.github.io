      <description>Introduction This post is a soft update to my previous post on Exploring UITFs in the Philippines. One limitation of that study is that the historical prices used were limited to the past 12 months only. In this post, I’m going to share how to scrape up to 5 years worth of historical prices from Bloomberg.com.
 Bloomberg “bulk-time-series” API I owe a big thanks to this wonderful article on finding the API by Greg Reda.</description>

What are the available UITFs in the Philippines? Which banks offer them? What are the different types of UITFs? What are the differences between each type?</description>

      <description>This is my very first blog post. I started this blog so I can share some cool stuff I’ve been working on as I’m discovering my way through data science. I decided to start a blog of my own since I’ve been learning a lot about data science and many things in general from blogs of other people. I believe this is a very efficient way of sharing my own analyses and projects to others and all other people who might find their way here.</description>
