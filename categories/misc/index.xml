      <description>This is my very first blog post. I started this blog so I can share some cool stuff I’ve been working on as I’m discovering my way through data science. I decided to start a blog of my own since I’ve been learning a lot about data science and many things in general from blogs of other people. I believe this is a very efficient way of sharing my own analyses and projects to others and all other people who might find their way here.</description>
